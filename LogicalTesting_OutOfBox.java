	Name, Place, Overall Experience, Current Organization, Previous Organization, Roles and Responsibilities.
	About Automation- Only Selenium concepts and TestNG Framework. No Java programming skills, Only know the concepts.
	Used to prepare java scripts for Regression suite and execute the suite using TestNG Framework.
	Agile/Scrum Methodology.
	
	High-end software applications- Software with extreme quality.
	Opportunity to expand your technical knowledge beyond Selenium and work on the latest tools like Protractor, CyPress.
	I haven't given any chances to work in these technologies. Only then i can work and learn these technologies.
	
	Knowledge of SQL, Java concepts.
		
	How to Improve Software Quality?
	
	1. Test Early	
	Test early and Test often. Early testing will ensure that any defects do not 
	grow into larger, more complicated issues. The bigger the defect, the more expensive it becomes to iron out any issues.
	If we leave the issues at early, the issues grow exponentially making it harder to resolve.
	It increases testing coverage, accuracy and improves quality of the overall product.
	
	2. Communication plays a major role
	To improve software quality it is important that all team members to the project have full information
	about the software application through fluid communication channels.
	
	3. Long term Thinking, Planning and Strategy
	Effective Planning and Thinking makes the software quality better.
	Thinking is the hardest work there is. That is why so few people engage in it. Continuously we want to engage in thinking process
	as it leads the software to attain better quality.
	A good relationship between testers and developers can help the project software strategy develop effectively.
	
	4. Following the QA Standards
	Planning, Thinking, Implementing Strategies, Engaging and Continuous Improvement.
	
	Where there is a lag in testing?
	
	Challenges of Software Testing
	1. Test Environment Duplication.
	2. Lack of Communication.
	3. Unstable Environment.
	4. Insufficient Requirements Gathering.
	
	Risk Based Testing:
	It is one of the testing type carried out when there is risks like Tight timelines, Insufficient resources, Undefined scope, Continuosly change in requirements.
	It involves assessing the critical functionality and possible areas of defect
	Risk based testing prioritizes testing of features and functions of the software application which are more impactful and likely to have defects.
	
	Project Explanation
	Cigna PDP- It is the Healthcare Insurance Application in which we can enroll a member. It is the web based application which provides the member details
	for the CHS. User can add a member by getting his/her basic and demographic informations. Also, the member should have attained 65 years of age and the member 
	should be in either medicare Part A or Part B plan. Then only the members are eligible to enroll in this application. 
	
	Regression Suite:
	It is a test suite with the set of test scenarios related to Regression Test, that are designed to ensure that software is 
	accurate and correct after undergoing corrections or changes.
	
	We cannot automate OTP, Bar Code and Captcha by using selenium.
	
	HIPAA- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.	
	The HIPAA rules and regulations consists of three major components, the HIPAA Privacy rules, Security rules, and Breach Notification rules.
	
	11 key mobile app testing challenges
	1. Network Bandwidth.
	2. OS oriented Platform- Windows, iOS and Android.
	3. Device oreinted- Screen size and resolution.
	4. Battery usage.
	5. Globalisation testing.
	6. Seamless user experience.
	7. Security concerns.
	
	Test Plan:
	1. Scope/Aim- Description about the project and features to be tested and not tested.
	2. Test Approach- Describes the various activities and way of working involved in the execution.
	3. Test Environment- Test bed where the testing takes place.
	4. Test Methodology- Methods that are used to test the Functional and Non Functional requirements.
	5. Roles and Responsibilities
	6. Risk- 
	7. Mitigation Plan- The process of developing options and actions to enhance opportunities and reduce threats to project objectives.
	8. Test Deliverables- Test artifacts and Test execution oriented documents are given to Stakeholders of the Software project.
	9. Test Automation
	10. Effort Estimation- It gives the details of Cost, Time taken and Resources involved.
	11. Entry and Exit criteria
	
	Why we go for Manual Testing?
	----------------------------------
	1. Human eye captures more defects.
	2. Everything cannot be automated l ike Captcha, I mage, Animation, Video, etc.
	3. Report prepared by the manual testers will be always detailed because manual testers are strong in Domain knowledge.
	while automation testers are strong in technical knowlege.
